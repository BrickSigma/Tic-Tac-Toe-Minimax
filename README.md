# Tic-Tac-Toe
 A simple replica of tic-tac-toe using the minimax algorithm and raylib

## How to use
 There are two different versions of tic-tac-toe in this projects:  
 - A terminal based version,
 - A GUI based one.

 The GUI based version runs off the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) library  

 To build both versions, just run `make` in the root directory of the project. To build either one of the projects, run `make terminal` or `make main`.  

## Note
The raylib header and shared library files have already been included in this project, but of you want to use your own build of raylib just change the `INCLUDE` and `LIB` path in the `Makefile`.
